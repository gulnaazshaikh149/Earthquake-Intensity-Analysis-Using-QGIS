# Results
Observing seismic waves moving through the Earth's crust was remarkable. Notably, certain regions showed clusters of seismic activity, offering valuable insights into specific earthquake-prone areas. 

The data revealed various seismic events, ranging from minor tremors to powerful quakes, each displaying distinct patterns and energy releases. 

Categorizing these earthquakes into low, medium, and high magnitudes, observed as black dots, red markers, and purple symbols respectively, showcased their occurrences. 

Over the last month, frequent low and medium magnitude earthquakes occurred, while high magnitude events were scarce, potentially causing significant impacts, especially in densely populated areas like the Middle East, affecting water resources and potentially leading to loss of life. 

Notably, seismic events displayed a diverse range of magnitudes and depths, showcasing the complexity of the Earth's subsurface structures and their influence on seismic behavior. Additionally, high magnitude earthquakes often coincided with surrounding low and medium magnitude events, illustrating the intricate relationship between seismic activities of varying intensities.
